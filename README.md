# OperatorExercise

I wantedto see what would happen if I violated the rules of this program, so I entered in values that weren't integers and that would quit my program.
I also tried to divide by zero with the same result.
I used try/catch to get around this, but I'm wondering if there's a way to make it less repetitive. Also, is there a way to use this so that they can try the operation again instead of leaving them on an error and moving on to the next one?
